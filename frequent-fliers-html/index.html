    <h2 id="what">What is Kite Fighting?</h2>
    <p id="p2">Kite fighting is a fun and exciting sport that can be played by all ages.
        The goal in kite fighting is to cut their oppenent's kite string mid-air, sending their kite crashing down.
        To do this, many fighters use special strings coated in glass or other abrasive materials to help slice through their opponentâ€™s line.

    <h2 id="history">History of Kite Fighting</h2>
    <p id="p2">
        It is thought to have originated over 2,000 years ago in Asia, most notably in China, India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
        Competitors traditionally would coat their kite string with various abrasive matierals, such as ground glass or crushed pottery.
        Nowadays, synthetic strings are used due to saftey and environmental concerns.
